With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing1. What is affiliate marketing?\u00a0Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!2. What is an affiliate program?\u00a0An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?\u00a0\u00a0Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.\u00a0 Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?\u00a0Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\u00a05. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing? \u00a0Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\u00a06. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?\u00a0Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.7. Where do I find qualified publishers?\u00a0The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?\u00a0An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\u00a09. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?\u00a0Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.10. What is a super affiliate?\u00a0A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.\u00a0 Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.11. How do we track publisher sales activity?\u00a0Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.\u00a012. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?\u00a0Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.13. How can affiliate marketing help my business?Affiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:\u00a0It allows you to save time and money on marketing, which frees you up to focus on other aspects of your business.\u00a0You get access to friendly marketers who are eager to help you succeed.\u00a0It also helps you to promote your products by sharing links and banners with a new audience.\u00a0It offers high ROI(Return on investment) and is cost-effective.\u00a014.

Do you have to pay to sign up for an affiliate program?\u00a0To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.17. What is a commission rate?\u00a0Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.Who manages your affiliate program?\u00a0Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.18. What is a cookie?\u00a0Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration19.

Most importantly, keep in mind that success in affiliate marketing takes some time. Don't be discouraged if you're not immediately making sales or earning money. It takes most new affiliates months to make a full-time income.","link":"https:\/\/techncruncher.blogspot.com\/2022\/06\/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html","pubDate":"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 13:03:00 +0000","source":"TechCrunch","category":"technology"},{"title":"What is Blockchain: Everything You Need to Know (2022)","content":"If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.\u00a0Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.So, What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201dMore information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.How does blockchain work?Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.Here\u2019s how it works:Someone or a computer will transactsThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.A network of computers can confirm the transaction.When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a blockThe blocks are linked together to create a history. if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': '8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text\/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + ':\/\/www.topcreativeformat.com\/8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.How are Blockchains used?Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.What is Blockchain Decentralization?Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.Pros and Cons of BlockchainBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.\u00a0ProsAccuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.Safe, private, and easy transactionsProvides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal informationConsData storage has limits.The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.It has a risk of being used for illicit activities\u00a0Frequently Asked Questions About BlockchainI\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.What is the most prominent blockchain company?Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.Who owns Blockchain?Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency\u00a0What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.Final SayingBlockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

In a court filing, the SEC says that Musk filed paperwork with the SEC disclosing his purchase of Twitter shares 11 days after an SEC-mandated deadline to do so. (Federal law, as the SEC notes in its statement, requires investors to publicly report when they have acquired a more than 5 percent stake in a company.) This delay, according to the regulator, allowed Musk to buy up even more Twitter stock at a time when other investors were unaware of his involvement with the company. From the lawsuit: During the period that Musk was required to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership but had failed to do so, he spent more than $500 million purchasing additional shares of Twitter common stock. Because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices, which did not yet reflect the undisclosed material information of Musk\u2019s beneficial ownership of more than five percent of Twitter common stock and investment purpose. In total, Musk underpaid Twitter investors by more than $150 million for his purchases of Twitter common stock during this period. Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm. The regulator has been investigating Musk for years, and has long been at odds with the owner of X. At one point, the SEC accused Musk of attempting to stall and use \u201cgamesmanship\u201d to delay its investigation into his investment in Twitter. Last month, Musk shared a copy of a letter addressed to SEC Chair Gary Gensler in which Musk\u2019s lawyer, Alex Spiro, accused the regulator of \u201csix years of harassment\u201d targeting Musk. The letter indicated that Musk refused a settlement offer from the SEC related to its Twitter investigation. Musk also faced a class action lawsuit from other Twitter investors and an FTC probe related to the delayed disclosure. However, as The New York Times notes, it\u2019s unclear if the SEC\u2019s latest action will amount to much, as Gensler is expected to step down following the inauguration of President Donald Trump. X didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement to The Times, Spiro called the SEC\u2019s action a \u201ca single-count ticky-tack complaint,\" calling it \u201can admission by the S.E.C. that they cannot bring an actual case.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/big-tech\/sec-lawsuit-claims-musk-gained-over-150-million-by-delaying-twitter-stake-disclosure-002627091.html?src=rss","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/big-tech\/sec-lawsuit-claims-musk-gained-over-150-million-by-delaying-twitter-stake-disclosure-002627091.html?src=rss","pubDate":"Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:26:27 +0000","source":"Engadget","category":"technology"},{"title":"Sonos' chief product officer is also leaving the company","content":"Sonos is continuing to clean house as the company recovers from the hits it took following a disastrous mobile app redesign last year. Just a day after CEO Patrick Spence departed the company, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin is also leaving. He will act as an advisor to interim CEO Tom Conrad during the leadership transition before fully exiting Sonos. Conrad informed Sonos employees about the latest leadership change in a company-wide email today. The CPO role is being made redundant, with Sonos' product team reporting directly to Conrad for the time being. Sonos has been in a tailspin since releasing a mobile app update in May that contained many bugs and was missing key features. The company's financial results took a dive, and it laid off about 100 employees in August. Sonos has made several efforts to keep customers aware of its plans to recover from the app launch, and the decision to replace top leadership seems like the latest move to win back public trust in the business.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/audio\/speakers\/sonos-chief-product-officer-is-also-leaving-the-company-223256031.html?src=rss","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/audio\/speakers\/sonos-chief-product-officer-is-also-leaving-the-company-223256031.html?src=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:32:56 +0000","source":"Engadget","category":"technology"},{"title":"Pixelfed, Instagram's decentralized competitor, is now on iOS and Android","content":"Pixelfed is now available as a mobile apps for both iOS and Android.

The platform runs on ActivityPub, the same protocol that powers several other decentralized social networks in the fediverse, such as Mastodon and Flipboard.

The first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2025 is confirmed for January 22 at 1PM ET in San Jose, CA, where Samsung\u2019s \u201cNext Big Thing\u201d (to borrow a 14-year-old marketing slogan) will be revealed. What exactly will be on tap? Well, apart from a few sure bets and some likely leaks, only those sworn to a blood oath under an NDA know for certain. But here are the most likely products and features we\u2019ll see. Galaxy S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra Galaxy S24 UltraSam Rutherford for Engadget Much like Apple reveals its latest iPhones at its first fall event, Samsung typically launches its mainline Galaxy S flagships at its first Unpacked shindig of the year. You can bet the farm that there will be Galaxy S25 phones at this event. And given Samsung\u2019s recent trend of launching three tiers of flagships \u2014 standard, Plus and Ultra \u2014 you can bet we\u2019ll see that again. (Samsung could technically change the brand names, but the three-layered lineup is practically guaranteed.) There\u2019s even an FCC certification (first spotted by 91Mobiles) to dispel any doubts. The degree of certainty falls sharply once we dig into the phones\u2019 features. A subtle redesign with rounded corners, flatter edges and thinner bezels appears likely based on a leaked video posted to Reddit and images from reputable tipster Ice Universe. But this isn\u2019t expected to be the generation where Samsung\u2019s hiring of a former Mercedes-Benz designer will lead to drastic aesthetic changes. Android Headlines also posted plenty of pictures of the purported Galaxy S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra that confirm the relatively minor redesign. The site also claims the screen size for the Galaxy S25 and S25+ are unchanged from last year at 6.2 and 6.7 inches, respectively. The Ultra gets an ever-so-slightly bigger display at 6.9 inches. Qualcomm At least in the US, the phone is practically guaranteed to use Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which the chip-maker revealed in October. (Qualcomm even listed Samsung among the companies launching devices with that processor \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d) Like just about every flagship processor these days, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is built for on-device generative AI, which aligns with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy AI blitz in recent models. We don\u2019t know whether the company will split its S25 processors between Snapdragon (US and other markets) and Exynos (everywhere else), but Ice Universe has claimed it will be all Snapdragon this generation. That would be a good thing, given what\u2019s often a glaring performance and battery life disparity favoring Qualcomm. Samsung is rumored to stick with last-generation OLED displays (made with M13 organic materials) instead of the brighter and more efficient M14 OLED panels used in the iPhone 16 Pro and Google Pixel 9. Logic suggests Samsung would want its best homemade screen in its best phones \u2014 especially when its competitors are already using it. But it could stick with the cheaper panels to keep the bill of materials down. Perhaps it calculated that better displays don\u2019t make for better generative AI (the obsession of nearly every tech company right now), while the latest Qualcomm chip does. Speaking of AI, expect Samsung to devote a perhaps agonizingly long portion of the event to generative AI features. The hit-or-miss DigiTimes reported last month that the Galaxy S25 series will include \u201can AI Agent that provides personalized clothing suggestions and transport information.\u201d What that would look like in practice is anyone\u2019s guess, but I\u2019m not sure I want to know. Samsung The phones will run Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 on top of Android 15. We know this because Samsung said in October that its user experience (based on Android 15) will launch on the next Galaxy S flagships. It\u2019s already available in beta for Galaxy S24 phones. Samsung has said that One UI 7 will be its \"first integrated AI platform.\" It added that Galaxy phones \"will become true AI companions\" that are able to understand natural language derived from speech, images and text. On the camera front, Ice Universe claims (via Android Headlines) it\u2019s \u201cconfirmed\u201d that only the ultra-wide sensor will see an upgrade in the Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 to 50MP from 12MP in last year\u2019s model. The leaker says the S25 Ultra will stick with a 200MP main sensor, 10MP 3x zoom and 50MP 5x zoom. Galaxy S24 UltraSam Rutherford for Engadget Samsung will add the Qi2 wireless charging standard to its new flagships \u2014 and that comes straight from the horse\u2019s (aka, the Wireless Power Consortium\u2019s) mouth. However, leaker chunvn8888 (aka \u201cyawn\u201d) says Samsung\u2019s phones won\u2019t have built-in magnets for Qi2\u2019s native MagSafe in everything but name charging. Instead, the leaker says Samsung will sell a first-party case with a Qi2 magnetic ring to enable that. (Gotta move those accessories, baby!) Rumors have buzzed about an alleged Galaxy S25 Slim with a \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 slimmer design joining the trio at some point this year. That\u2019s something Apple is also rumored to be working on. However, given the FCC certifications only appear to cover the familiar trio of flagships, that phone (if it\u2019s in the pipeline at all) may not arrive until later in the year. Galaxy Ring 2, Samsung XR and AR glasses Galaxy RingSam Rutherford for Engadget DigiTimes reported in December that Samsung would show off (or maybe just tease) the Galaxy Ring 2 and augmented reality (AR) glasses during its January Unpacked event. The Taiwanese publication says the Galaxy Ring 2 will add two more sizes to the nine from the original model, which only launched in July. The second-gen wearable health tracker is said to add new AI features (surprise!) and updated sensors for more accurate measurements. The Galaxy Ring 2 is also rumored to last longer than the current model\u2019s maximum of seven days. Google DigiTimes also claims Samsung\u2019s AR glasses \u2014 which the company has confirmed it\u2019s working on \u2014 will look like regular prescription glasses and weigh around 50g. It says the futuristic glasses would use Google\u2019s Gemini AI, which aligns with what we already know about Samsung\u2019s partnership with Google and Qualcomm on Android XR. But given the lack of supply chain rumors surrounding the glasses, it\u2019s likely that any mention at the event would amount to little more than a teaser, a la its grand reveal of... a stinkin\u2019 render for the first Galaxy Ring at Unpacked 2024. We also know Samsung is co-developing an Android XR (extended reality) headset \u2014 codenamed Project Moohan \u2014 alongside Google and Qualcomm. The \u201clightweight\u201d and \u201cergonomically designed\u201d headset will have a \u201cstate-of-the-art display,\u201d passthrough video and natural multi-modal input. Google\u2019s renderings show a wearable reminiscent of Apple\u2019s $3,500 Vision Pro. Project MoohanGoogle \/ Samsung Since Google only recently began offering a developer kit and API for the platform, any glimpse of it at Unpacked wouldn\u2019t likely include an imminent release or deep dive into its hardware. Engadget will have full coverage of Samsung\u2019s first Unpacked event of 2025. More to come on January 22!

Now, finally, there\u2019s a legit full-fledged trailer. This is opportune timing, as The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep hits Netflix on February 11. The big hook here? Geralt is voiced by Doug Cockle, reprising his role from the video games. Anya Chalotra and Joey Batey (Yennefer of Vengerberg and Jaskier in the live action show) are also reprising their roles. It\u2019s set in the universe of the TV show, surrounding events that occurred during the first season, but is based on a short story by franchise creator Andrzej Sapkowski. The original story, called \u201cA Little Sacrifice,\u201d involves Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village, leading to a conflict between humans and merpeople. It\u2019s generally considered one of the better short stories in the canon. There\u2019s an underwater city, which is always a good time. The movie is directed by Kang Hei Chul. He was a storyboard artist for The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, which was a prequel that followed Geralt\u2019s mentor Vesemir. Studio Mir is on animation duties, the same South Korean studio that worked on Nightmare of the Wolf. This company has an absolutely amazing pedigree. It animated the hit cartoon X-Men \u201897, but also stuff like The Legend of Korra, Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, My Adventures with Superman and Voltron: Legendary Defender, among many others. The studio is currently finishing up the upcoming Devil May Cry anime, also for Netflix. A fourth game in The Witcher franchise is coming, but this one stars Ciri instead of Geralt. The fifth and final season of The Witcher TV show is expected to premiere on Netflix in 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/entertainment\/streaming\/the-new-witcher-animated-film-finally-has-a-legit-trailer-195457579.html?src=rss","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/entertainment\/streaming\/the-new-witcher-animated-film-finally-has-a-legit-trailer-195457579.html?src=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:54:57 +0000","source":"Engadget","category":"technology"},{"title":"How to talk to ChatGPT on your phone","content":"ChatGPT has had support for voice conversations since the end of 2023, but if you\u2019re new to OpenAI\u2019s chatbot, figuring out how to converse with it can be tricky since there are a couple of ways to go about it. In this guide, I'll explain the main differences between ChatGPT's two voice modes and how to use both of them.\u00a0 What is ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode? As of the writing of this article, OpenAI offers two different ways of interacting with ChatGPT using your voice: \u201cStandard\u201d and \u201cAdvanced.\u201d The former is available to all users, with usage counting against one\u2019s message limit. \u201cAdvanced,\u201d meanwhile, has more granular restrictions. As a free user, OpenAI offers a monthly preview of the tool. Subscribing to the company\u2019s $20 per month Plus plan allows you to use Advanced Voice daily. OpenAI notes daily limits may change, but either way, the company promises to notify users 15 minutes before they\u2019re about to hit their usage cap. Pro users can use Advanced Voice as much as they want, provided they do so in a way that\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d and complies with the company\u2019s policies. Outside of those limits, the primary difference between the two modes is the sophistication of the underlying models powering them. Per OpenAI, Advanced Voice is natively multi-modal, meaning it can process more than just text input. In practice, this translates to Advanced Voice offering capabilities that aren\u2019t possible with Standard Mode, which is limited to reading a transcript of what you say to your phone. In addition to \u201chearing\u201d your voice, ChatGPT in Advanced Voice can simultaneously process video and images. It\u2019s even possible to screen share with the chatbot, making it possible for it to guide you through using an app on your phone. Additionally, OpenAI says Advanced Voice\u2019s multi-modality means ChatGPT can produce a more natural voice and is better able to pick up non-verbal cues. How do you start a voice conversation with ChatGPT? Igor Bonifacic for Engadget As mentioned above, OpenAI offers two different ways of interacting with ChatGPT using your voice. The steps below will show you how to access them on your iPhone or Android device. First, you need to download the ChatGPT app (Android, iOS). The features detailed in this guide aren\u2019t available through the ChatGPT integration offered by Apple through its AI suite. To use Standard mode, tap the microphone icon to the right of the Message bar. If you need to grant the ChatGPT app access to your phone\u2019s microphone, you can do so through its settings menu. After ChatGPT begins recording your prompt, tap the checkmark icon for the chatbot to start processing your question. If you want it to discard what you said, press the x icon. To use Advanced Mode, tap the waveform icon to the right of the Message bar. Tap the microphone icon if you want to mute your phone\u2019s mic. You can exit Advanced Mode at any time by pressing the x icon. How do you share a photo of your screen with ChatGPT while having a voice conversation? If you want to screen share with ChatGPT or share a photo or video with it, tap the three-dots icon and select Share Screen, Upload Photo or Take Photo. If you don\u2019t see those options, update to the latest version of the ChatGPT app. You may also live in a country where OpenAI isn\u2019t offering those features yet. See below for more information. How many voice options are available? The first time you use Advanced Voice Mode, you\u2019ll be prompted to select a tone of voice for ChatGPT. Right now, OpenAI offers nine different options. I\u2019ve listed them below, along with the company\u2019s descriptions of each one. Arbor \u2014 Easygoing and versatile Breeze \u2014 Animated and earnest Cove \u2014 Composed and direct Ember \u2014 Confident and optimistic Juniper \u2014 Open and upbeat Maple \u2014 Cheerful and candid Sol \u2014 Savvy and relaxed Spruce \u2014 Calm and affirming Vale \u2014 Bright and inquisitive If you want to change ChatGPT\u2019s voice, follow these steps: Bring up the sidebar by tapping the two-dash. Open the Settings menu by tapping the three-dots icon. Scroll down and tap Voice. Select the voice you want ChatGPT to use. You can also change ChatGPT\u2019s voice directly from the Advanced Voice interface by tapping the slider icon. Are there regional restrictions on Advanced Voice Mode? Some Advanced Voice Mode features aren\u2019t available in every country where OpenAI offers ChatGPT. Specifically, the video, screen share and image upload capabilities OpenAI introduced in December aren\u2019t available in the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/ai\/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-on-your-phone-193633643.html?src=rss","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/ai\/how-to-talk-to-chatgpt-on-your-phone-193633643.html?src=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:36:34 +0000","source":"Engadget","category":"technology"},{"title":"DoJ remotely cleaned thousands of computers infected with Chinese malware","content":"The Department of Justice and the FBI shared today that they have completed a project to remove malware used by Chinese hackers from computers in the US. The effort was essentially a court-approved counter-hack that remotely deleted malware known as PlugX from more than 4,200 computers. The agencies will notify the US owners of those impacted machines about the operation through their internet service providers. According to the DOJ press release, hacker groups known as Mustang Panda and Twill Typhoon received backing from the Chinese government to use PlugX to infect, control and gather information from computers outside China. The action to delete the PlugX malware from US computers began in August 2024. It was conducted in cooperation with French law enforcement and with Sekoia.io, a France-based private cybersecurity company. Sekoia.io has found PlugX malware in more than 170 countries. The Mustang Panda group has been conducting infiltration efforts around the world since at least 2014. For instance, cybersecurity firm ESET found that Mustang Panda gained access to cargo shipping companies' computers in Norway, Greece and the Netherlands in March. And the group was one of several China-linked hacking organizations identified as compromising telecommunications systems across the Asia-Pacific region in reports last summer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/cybersecurity\/doj-remotely-cleaned-thousands-of-computers-infected-with-chinese-malware-191837967.html?src=rss","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/cybersecurity\/doj-remotely-cleaned-thousands-of-computers-infected-with-chinese-malware-191837967.html?src=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:18:37 +0000","source":"Engadget","category":"technology"},{"title":"Mark Zuckerberg plans to lay off an additional five percent of Meta's workforce","content":"Meta is preparing for even more layoffs, according to reporting by Bloomberg. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a company memo that he plans on cutting about five percent of its \"low-performers.\" \u201cI\u2019ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster,\u201d Zuckerberg said in the memo. \u201cWe typically manage out people who aren\u2019t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we\u2019re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.\u201d All told, this could result in 10 percent fewer staff at Meta, once attrition is accounted for. Bloomberg suggested that the forthcoming pink slips will focus on people \u201cwho have been with the company long enough to receive a performance rating.\u201d Between increased layoffs and attrition, nearly 7,000 Meta staff might be leaving the company in the near future. This follows a firing spree that began in late 2022, eventually impacting over 20,000 workers. The company also laid off 60 technical program managers earlier this month. \"A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster. People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and fulfilling,\" Zuckerberg said in 2024. Nothing says \u201cfun and fulfilling\u201d like living in constant fear of being fired. Meta has had an unusual year so far. We are only halfway through January and the Zuck has already ended third-party fact checking across Meta platforms, appointed UFC CEO Dana White to Meta\u2019s board and took a trip to Mar-a-lago to bend the knee. The company also changed its \"Hateful Content\" policy to make it safer for homophobes and it came out that Instagram had been shadowbanning common LGBTQ hashtags.\u00a0This article originally appeared on Engadget at https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/big-tech\/mark-zuckerberg-plans-to-lay-off-an-additional-five-percent-of-metas-workforce-182651886.html?src=rss","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/big-tech\/mark-zuckerberg-plans-to-lay-off-an-additional-five-percent-of-metas-workforce-182651886.html?src=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:26:51 +0000","source":"Engadget","category":"technology"},{"title":"Threads is starting to test community notes internally","content":"Last week, Meta decided it would replace its professional fact-checking program with X-style \"Community Notes\" and it looks like a version of the feature is already being tested on Threads. Alessandro Paluzzi, a developer who frequently posts leaked details on Meta's apps, shared three screenshots that show an early look of what the Community Notes might look like in Threads. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson described the screenshots as an \"internal prototype\" and said the feature wasn't being tested outside of the company.\u00a0 Paluzzi's images show a new \"Write Community Note\" option in the menu you can access in the corner of a Threads post. If you select it, it looks like you'll be able to anonymously submit your note, and if it's rated as helpful, it will appear under the post. The whole setup is not dissimilar from how X uses Community Notes, which started as a feature called \"Birdwatch\" on Twitter before Elon Musk acquired and renamed the company. Alessandro Paluzzi Community Notes are just one of the ways Threads is changing under Meta's new approach to moderation. The app, which was against the sharing and promoting of \"political\" content, will now also suggest political posts. Instagram and Threads head Adam Mosseri demonstrated how you can adjust the amount of political content you see in your feed in a short video shared to Threads today. Meta is giving users three options to choose from: \"See less,\" which attempts to weed out political content, \"Standard,\" which suggests some political content and \"See more,\" which treats political content like everything else on the app. It's not clear that Community Notes or toggles for political content address the actual issues users have with Threads, or if they'll make anyone happier. They do fit with the \"free speech warrior\" image Meta is trying to project, though. Update January 14, 2025, 12:26 PM ET: This story has been updated to add more information from a Meta spokesperson.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/social-media\/threads-is-starting-to-test-community-notes-232150151.html?src=rss","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/social-media\/threads-is-starting-to-test-community-notes-232150151.html?src=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:26:11 +0000","source":"Engadget","category":"technology"},{"title":"Substack is now letting all publishers broadcast live video","content":"Substack tested live video last year, allowing Substack Bestsellers (the company\u2019s top users) to stream video and connect with a live audience and even collaborate with other Bestsellers. Now, the feature is open to every Substack publisher who wants to go live. The only primary requirement besides needing an account is having at least 10 free subscribers. Publishers who go live can read comments as they come in, similar to Twitch. They can also collaborate with other publishers by asking them to hop on a call. Currently, Substack is only supporting up to three people in a single call. After your stream ends, you get a copy of the VOD and also some AI-generated notes. The VOD can be posted as its own post to ensure readers and fans who missed out can experience the stream on their own time. The VODs are made public by default when shared as a post, but they can also be paywalled. Substack\u2019s AI can generate clips you can share to attract viewers to watch the main VOD if you\u2019re interested in promoting your content elsewhere. Substack claims that its Bestsellers are happy with the feature, which allows them to engage with their readers and viewers better than before. The full impact of live video on Substack still remains questionable until more publishers try it out. Given how many options there are for streaming live video these days, it\u2019s far from a sure thing it\u2019ll catch on here.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

The old municipal changing facilities, dating from the 1970s, had become too run-down to renovate. And so the local authority decided to provide new facilities for its football team, FC Venoge. The building is organised along the axis of the football pitch, stretching out elegantly and topped with a large metal roof. The roof looks paper-thin, its ridge echoing the ridges of the Jura mountains in the background. The building is mainly made of wood, covering an area of less than 400 m2. It houses changing rooms and showers for the players along with a refreshment bar and its associated amenities and a space for the bowls club.","link":"https:\/\/www.archdaily.com\/1025595\/daillens-sports-facility-localarchitecture","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 12:00:00 +0000","source":"ArchDaily","category":"art_design"},{"title":"Rusty House \/ studio on the rye","content":"Location and Background - Rusty House on the Rye is a 1950s property located in the Holly Grove Conservation Area in Peckham, South London. Situated on the corner of Bellenden Road, leading to Rye Lane, the property's prime position makes it highly visible from two main streets. Purchased 14 years ago by the owner Victoria, she was regularly approached by developers wanting to buy and build on the land. However, she decided to take matters into her own hands, opting to expand her home and make the most of the space herself. Client Vision and Brief - The project got off the ground in early 2023 and Victoria was keen to work with a local, all-female team for the design and engineering. She selected local architect Sarah Borowiecka, director of studio on the rye to oversee the process. For Sarah the brief was clear: the client wanted to add a two-storey extension while maintaining side access from the front garden into the rear. The garden was a standout feature and integral to the project. Additionally, the client sought a larger kitchen, to accommodate working from home, a snug, a utility room, and a new master bedroom. The existing home also needed updates, including resolving damp and ventilation issues and modernizing the rooms to be more energy-efficient.","link":"https:\/\/www.archdaily.com\/1025537\/rusty-house-studio-on-the-rye","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:00:00 +0000","source":"ArchDaily","category":"art_design"},{"title":"What If Every Brick Had a Future? Rethinking Demolition and Material Reuse in the Circular Economy","content":"For decades, the life cycle of buildings was a simple formula: planning, design, construction, demolition, and, of course, the great villain in this history: the landfill. Over time, architectural practice began embracing concepts like reuse, disassembly, and circular demolition, but often as secondary elements, part of the gradual shift toward a circular economy in construction. But what if these principles were no longer exceptions? What if we crafted or chose every building component to maintain value and purpose beyond its original use? The truth is, there is life after demolition. This transition\u2014from demolition to practices focusing on reuse, repurposing, and sustainable dismantling\u2014is edging closer to reality. By the time 2030 arrives, we could fundamentally reshape how we approach processes, buildings, and the market itself. As these changes unfold, we must assess how our strategies align with the evolving goals and challenges related to sustainability\u2014and, of course, the new opportunities they bring.","link":"https:\/\/www.archdaily.com\/1025567\/what-if-every-brick-had-a-future-rethinking-demolition-and-material-reuse-in-the-circular-economy","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 07:30:00 +0000","source":"ArchDaily","category":"art_design"},{"title":"Community Hall \/ graal","content":"Spread out over a vast area along the Mauldre valley, Beynes is composed of an old town, home to the majority of services and institutions, and adjoined by three residential hamlets, a military camp and a national forest. At the junction of these four inhabited neighbourhoods, and away from any urban development, the new community hall asserts itself prominently in this hilly agricultural landscape punctuated by suburban housing. The challenge in designing this building is to fit in both, a domestic and a rural scale, while at the same time offering a central facility with which all residents can identify, thereby reinforcing their sense of belonging to this dispersed territory. Located alongside the departmental road serving the valley, the building overlooks an agricultural wasteland created by the same road, the railway line below and an old local road, to which the building must logically connect to. A hybrid is formed from an iconic \"roadside\" architecture and a regionalist reimagination of the agricultural barn, the hall emerges from the ground as a softly materialized mineral volume, covered by a two-faceted, slender gable roof that cuts into the landscape.","link":"https:\/\/www.archdaily.com\/1025487\/community-hall-graal","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2025 07:00:00 +0000","source":"ArchDaily","category":"art_design"},{"title":"Foster & Partners and Norm Architects Announced as Jury Members for the BHW Awards by inHAUS","content":"Architects from all over the world are invited to participate in the \"Best House in the World\" competition, a new international contest designed to discover and reward innovative residential architectural designs that have not yet been built and are still in development.
